The ingenuity of the great Canadian log drive is the use of natural rivers to
transport logs. But as every Canadian knows, not every body of water is so
free-flowing, especially in winter. In slow-moving sections of a river, it's
common for the surface of the water to freeze overnight, trapping the logs. The
log drivers can break up the ice with their long-handled picks, but we'll give
them a helping hand anyway. With dynamite.

Paul is in charge of coordinating the placement of explosive charges. This is
the best dynamite-related job in the log drive, not because it's the safest
(which it is), but because you get to light the fuse at the end. We can model
the relevant section of the river as a number line with NN log drivers and MM
clusters of frozen logs. The ith log driver is at position P_i (measured in
metres), and the ith cluster of logs is at position Q_i. All N+M of these
initial positions are distinct.

Every second, each log driver can move one metre to either the left or right, or
remain stationary. Multiple log drivers are permitted to occupy the same
position. When a log driver occupies the same position as a cluster of frozen
logs, they can spend S seconds to set an explosive charge, and can continue
moving after that.

As soon as an explosive charge is in place at every cluster, Paul will begin the
detonation process by lighting the universal fuse (don't worry, the fuse is long
enough to allow the other log drivers to clear out in time). If Paul commands
the log drivers optimally, what's the minimum amount of time after which he can
light the fuse?
