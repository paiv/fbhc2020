Problem A: Travel Restrictions

2020 has been a tough year for travelers. Air travel is especially problematic
as passengers need to spend long periods in security lines, waiting areas, and
crowded cabins where social distancing is difficult to maintain.

To minimize the spread of COVID-19, each airline has decided to reorganize all
of their flight routes in a linear fashion. The airlines are hoping that by not
making any one country a "hub", the spread of the virus will be significantly
limited.

An airline's flights normally service NN countries, running in various
directions. Amidst the pandemic, each airline has carefully arranged these N
countries in a sequence with each assigned a number from 1 to N. Flights are
limited to run only between pairs of countries that are adjacent in this
sequence, with service in both directions. No other flights are available. That
is, flights are available from country i to country j if and only if
|i - j| = 1
