Problem B: Alchemy

Edgar and his younger brother Alfred are alchemists in search of the legendary
Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone (also known as the Red Stone, the
Fifth Element, and the Elixir of Life in liquid form) is a powerful alchemical
substance rumoured to support the transmutation of silver, gold, and even human
lives. Edgar is hoping to use the stone to restore his brother's body to its
original form following a terrifying human transmutation accident.

It is known that Philosopher's Stones break apart into an odd number of shards
when they're used up. After searching far and wide, Edgar has collected N
shards of what he believes to be a previously-used Philosopher's Stone, where N
is an odd integer. He believes that fusing these shards back together will yield
a real stone in its entirety.
