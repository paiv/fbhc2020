Every year, millions of logs are sent floating downstream in the great Canadian
log drive. But as every Canadian knows, you can't have a successful log drive
without logs. The first step in the logging season is to fell a great number of
trees, taking care not to pile the trees up in a way that will make them hard to
move.

Eva has been assigned a section of forest with N trees standing in a row.
Looking at them from the side and modeling the ground as a number line, the ith
tree is at position P_i (measured in metres) and has a height of
H_i metres. All of the trees are at distinct positions.

Eva would like to form the largest combined timber interval possible, as that
represents a series of trees that can all be pushed into the river at once.
Determine the maximum possible length that a combined timber interval could have
if Eva cuts down trees optimally.
